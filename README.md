# Citizen Grievance & Welfare Intelligent System

An AI-powered platform designed to streamline the process of filing grievances and accessing welfare information. This system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically categorize, prioritize, and cluster complaints, making it easier for authorities to manage and resolve citizen issues.

## 🚀 Features

- **Voice-to-Ticket**: Citizens can file grievances using voice commands.
- **AI Categorization**: Automatically detects the sector (Roads, Electricity, Water, etc.) based on description.
- **Intelligent Prioritization**: Uses sentiment analysis and keyword detection to flag urgent issues as "High Priority".
- **Real-time Tracking**: Provides unique IDs and live status updates for all complaints.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports English, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Hindi.
- **AI Chatbot**: A dedicated assistant to help users track complaints and explore welfare schemes.
